## Background
Admittedly, this was a project from a web development course I was taking. The original goal was to create a website that displayed items and allowed a user to interact and submit their own content. I tried to use this as an additional opportunity to better grasp the usage of the Google Maps API and maintaining a local database. 
<br/>

## Breakdown
The current iteration of the website has the following set of key components and functionalities – user account creation and caching, account login/logout, restaurant location submission, restaurant search, commenting and rating under a selected location, Google Maps geolocation and pin placement (to show local restaurants).

    py={'1em'}
    position={'relative'}
    direction={'row'}>
            <Center>
                ![The home screen.](/screenshots/rest2.png)
            </Center>
            <Center>
                ![The assessment screen.](/screenshots/rest1.png)
            </Center>
</Center>
Each of the account and submission related functionalities are processed using PHP to a MySQL database. To that note, I also implemented custom input and form validation, and parametrized queries to prevent SQL injection and/or broken queries to be sent.

    direction={'row'}>
            <Center
                pt={'1em'}
                px={'3em'}>
                    ![The home screen.](/screenshots/rest3.png)
            </Center>
</Center>
<Center
    position={'relative'}
    direction={'column'}>
            <Center
                pb={'1em'}
                px={'3em'}>
                    ![The home screen.](/screenshots/rest4.png)
            </Center>
</Center>
## Other Notes
Outside of general query difficulties, I was surprised that implementing persistent location from the Google Maps API presented the biggest challenge overall. Each time the user would navigate to a new page their location data and geolocation permission would reset, leading to errors loading related content. The solution entailed storing the user’s location data within a PHP session variable and adding specific checks to ensure the location request happens on initial load, as well as on a specific page if the user arrives by URL. Simple as it may sound, it ended up being quite time consuming.
